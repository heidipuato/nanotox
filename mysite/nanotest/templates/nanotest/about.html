                  <p class="card-text"> The concept of QSAR modeling is that physiological activity of particles can be in-
                    ferred from their associated chemical compositions. In this context, toxic effects of
                    nanoparticles can be modelled as a function of molecular descriptors that a nanoparticles
                    has. Molecular descriptors are the physicochemical properties of a molecule, this include
                    their molar volume, electronegativity, polarizability, size, spectral moments, etc..

                  <p class="card-text"> Perturbation theory is a method used to improve an approximation by calculating errors
                    or deviations from an initial solution.

                  </div>
                  <p class="card-text"> QSAR-Perturbation model or PT-QSAR model is the resulting technique of integrating
                    the perturbation theory in classic QSAR modeling. Using this model, the limitation
                    of classic QSAR was addressed. By generating NP-NP pairs, the classification of the
                    NPs are extended to consider the different experimental conditions it is under and the
                    several bio-target they are tested against
